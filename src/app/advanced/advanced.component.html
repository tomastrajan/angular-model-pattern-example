      <h4 id="factories">Available Model Factories</h4>
      <p>
        Models are created using model factory as shown in example <code>todo.service.ts</code>,
        check line <code>this.model = this.modelFactory.create(initialData);</code>.
        Multiple model factories are provided out of the box to support different use cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>create(initialData: T): Model&lt;T></code> - create basic model which is immutable by default (JSON cloning)</li>
        <li><code>createMutable(initialData: T): Model&lt;T></code> - create model with no immutability guarantees (you have to make sure that model consumers don't mutate and corrupt model state) but much more performance because whole cloning step is skipped</li>
        <li><code>createMutableWithSharedSubscription(initialData: T): Model&lt;T></code> - gain even more performance by skipping both immutability and sharing subscription between all consumers (eg situation in which many components are subscribed to single model)</li>
        <li><code>createWithCustomClone(initialData: T, clone: (data: T) => T)</code> - create immutable model by passing your custom clone function (JSON cloning doesn't support properties containing function or regex so custom cloning functionality might be needed)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="col s12">
      <h4 id="mutable-state">Enable mutable state</h4>
      <p>Model is immutable by default. It <strong>clones state for every
        subscribed component</strong> using <code>JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(data))</code>.
        <br>
        This works great in most circumstances but sometimes, when the data structure grows
        too big and updates happen too often, <code>JSON</code> API may be too slow for the task...
      </p>
      <p>
        Check this <a href="https://jsperf.com/deep-copy-vs-json-stringify-json-parse/5">jsPerf example</a>
        to get an idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mutable state is enabled simply by using <code>this.modelFactory.createMutable(initialData)</code> factory method.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5>Best practices</h5>
      <p>You should still implement one way data flow without direct data mutation even though it
      won't be prevented. This way you gain performance without loosing simplicity of your state
      management.</p>

    <div class="col s12">
      <h4 id="custom-clone">Use custom clone function</h4>
      <p>While <code>JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(data))</code> method of cloning is pretty great and handles
      most of the standard use cases, sometimes your model may contain objects like
        <code>/^regularExpression$/</code>, functions or recursive references which
        will break default cloning functionality.</p>
      <p>In these cases you can provide your own custom clone function to handle your specific use case.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col s12">
      <h4 id="resolve-data">Resolve data during route transition</h4>
      <p>This is a bit different approach to resolving data compared to standard
        Angular Router <code>resolve</code> property.
      </p>
      <p>Resolved data is usually returned to router and made accessible on the route object which
      is injected into component which consumes the resolved data.</p>
      <p>Conversely, only <code>boolean</code> flag is returned to the router when using model pattern and

resolved data is used to initialize service's model instead. Component then consumes
      service's model as usual using <code>this.todoService.todos$ | async</code> pipe in template
      or explicit subscription <code>this.todoService.todos$.subscribe(/* ... */)</code>.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col s12">
      <h4 id="combine-data">Combine data from multiple models</h4>
      <p>It is expected that you will create more than one model in any non-trivial application.
      These models will most likely correspond to the business (domain) features of
        you application and infrastructure concerns (eg: session management).</p>
      <p>Implementation of features which require access to the data of more than one model
        can simply be handled by employing built in RxJS operators like <code>.combineLatest()</code>.
